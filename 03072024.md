#### The contract has been sealed.  
协议已生效

```
"The contract has been sealed" is an idiomatic expression that means a deal or agreement has been finalized and made official.
Some expanded explanations:

It refers to the traditional practice of applying a wax seal or stamp to a formal legal contract to authenticate and complete it.

By saying "the contract has been sealed", it implies that all the terms have been agreed upon, any negotiations are concluded, and the parties involved have committed to fulfilling the contract.

It signifies that the contract now carries legal/binding force and the arrangements specified in it must be carried out.
It can be used both literally for formal legal contracts, as well as figuratively to indicate that an informal deal, bargain or resolution between parties has been solidified and is now set in stone.
So in essence, "the contract has been sealed" conveys that a negotiated agreement has reached its final, authorized and executed stage after which it goes into effect.
