#### The contract has been sealed.  
协议已生效

```
"The contract has been sealed" is an idiomatic expression that means a deal or agreement has been finalized and made official.
Some expanded explanations:

It refers to the traditional practice of applying a wax seal or stamp to a formal legal contract to authenticate and complete it.

By saying "the contract has been sealed", it implies that all the terms have been agreed upon, any negotiations are concluded, and the parties involved have committed to fulfilling the contract.

It signifies that the contract now carries legal/binding force and the arrangements specified in it must be carried out.
It can be used both literally for formal legal contracts, as well as figuratively to indicate that an informal deal, bargain or resolution between parties has been solidified and is now set in stone.
So in essence, "the contract has been sealed" conveys that a negotiated agreement has reached its final, authorized and executed stage after which it goes into effect.

And "ruin" can no longer be avoided.

"毁灭"将再也无法避免。`

```

指那些用智谋、狡猾或诡计的手段,来颠覆现有规则、秩序和期望的人。
指那些扰乱稳定、制造混乱,不循规蹈矩的人,他们会用创意的方式去偏离传统路径。

the term "Tricksters" refers to people who defy conventions,

Specifically, in this context, a Trickster likely means:

游戏开始: 

There's something Here.  

Hey, up there.

He's here, move in immediately.

Good. Now get running!  

This is our only chance!  

Stay calm! You can get away now!  

We'll retrieve the briefcase on our end.  

...suspects... not ... confirmed...   

...hold...your...positions...   

Hm...? What was that... ?  

Don't worry about us. Just concentrate on getting away!  

[Escape from the casino]  

But I have to say, showing yourself above that crowd earlier was an excellent move.  

Nice work as always, Joker.  

I bet Skull wouldn't pull it off that smoothly.  

This happens because you have no sense for aesthetics.  

Nobody asked you, Inari!

There he is!

Just run! Get out of there!  

Okay, the enemy's focus is on him. Looks like the rest of us can slip away.  

[Stop right there, you can get away ]  

Take them down Joker!  

Comparing power levels...
No threat. Get 'em, Joker!  

Good. You defeated them with ease!  

More of them!? Be careful!  

Joker, behind you! Go through that door!  

You should be able to get out that way!  
Hurry!  

Dude, can he even hear us!?  

Don't worry, I'm picking up everyone's voices. Just go, Joker!  

Hm? Wait a sec!  

What the -- (Fxx) I'm getting a weird reading heading your way!  

C'mon,run !  

Tch! We got away from a bunch of those guys in back, but there're still loads more of 'em...  

Where'd they go!? Damn it!  

I can't confirm the intruder's location.

Up ahead! Stop!  

This is bad! Hide, Joker!  

You'll never get away if you just keep fighting.  

Hide in the shadows, and sneak past when you see an opening!  

Hey are you sure he came in this way?  


Understood. I will continue the search!  

Alright, now's your chance! Make a run for it!  

Ugh! How many of them are there!?  

Everything okay? The security level will rise if you take too much time.  

I know, I know! I'm looking for another route. Just hang on.
