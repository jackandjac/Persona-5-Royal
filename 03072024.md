#### The contract has been sealed.  
协议已生效

```
"The contract has been sealed" is an idiomatic expression 
that means a deal or agreement has been finalized and made official.
Some expanded explanations:

It refers to the traditional practice of applying a wax seal or stamp to a formal 
legal contract to authenticate and complete it.

By saying "the contract has been sealed", it implies that all the terms have been agreed upon, 
any negotiations are concluded, and the parties involved have committed to fulfilling the contract.

It signifies that the contract now carries legal/binding force and the arrangements specified in it must be carried out.
It can be used both literally for formal legal contracts, as well as figuratively to indicate that an informal deal,
bargain or resolution between parties has been solidified and is now set in stone.
So in essence, "the contract has been sealed" conveys that a negotiated agreement has reached its final, 
authorized and executed stage after which it goes into effect.

The world is not as it should be.
It's filled with distortion,
And "ruin" can no longer be avoided.

```
distortion： 扭曲  

ruin： 废墟，毁灭  

avoid：避免  
```



`世界已不在是它应有的模样。
充满了扭曲,
"毁灭"将再也无法避免。`

Those who oppose fate and desire change...
From time to time, they were referred as Tricksters.
```
trickster : 捣蛋鬼
指那些反抗既定命运,不愿順从现状,而是渴望带来改变的人。
指那些用智谋、狡猾或诡计的手段,来颠覆现有规则、秩序和期望的人。
指那些扰乱稳定、制造混乱,不循规蹈矩的人,他们会用创意的方式去偏离传统路径。

the term "Tricksters" refers to people who defy conventions,
challenge the established order, and bring about change through unconventional or clever means.

convention: 
    1.
    a way in which something is usually done, especially within a particular area or activity. 惯例
    "the woman who overturned so many conventions of children's literature"
    2.
    an agreement between countries covering particular matters, especially one less formal than a treaty. 公约
    "the convention, signed by the six states bordering on the Black Sea, aims to prevent further pollution"

Specifically, in this context, a Trickster likely means:

Someone who opposes the predetermined "fate" or destiny laid out for them, and instead seeks to change the status quo 
through their words or actions.

A person who uses wit, cunning, mischief or trickery to subvert norms, rules or expectations in order to shake 
things upand create change.

An agent of chaos or disruption who doesn't follow the traditional path, but finds creative ways to deviate from it.

A mischievous figure who playfully or cleverly undermines existing power structures, belief systems or social orders.
Someone with a rebellious or non-conformist spirit who defies fate/destiny through deception, pranks or by bending rules.

The term "Trickster" has roots in mythology and folklore, 
referring to an archetype or character known for using trickery to upend reality. 
So in this sentence, it casts those desiring change in society as clever, unorthodox "Trickster" figures.

游戏开始: 

There's something Here.  

Hey, up there.

He's here, move in immediately.

Good. Now get running!  

This is our only chance!  

Stay calm! You can get away now!  

We'll retrieve the briefcase on our end.  

...suspects... not ... confirmed...   

...hold...your...positions...   

Hm...? What was that... ?  

Don't worry about us. Just concentrate on getting away!  

[Escape from the casino]  

But I have to say, showing yourself above that crowd earlier was an excellent move.  

Nice work as always, Joker.  

I bet Skull wouldn't pull it off that smoothly.  

This happens because you have no sense for aesthetics.  

Nobody asked you, Inari!

There he is!

Just run! Get out of there!  

Okay, the enemy's focus is on him. Looks like the rest of us can slip away.  

[Stop right there, you can't get away ]  

Take them down Joker!  

Comparing power levels...
No threat. Get 'em, Joker!  

Good. You defeated them with ease!  

More of them!? Be careful!  

Joker, behind you! Go through that door!  

You should be able to get out that way!  
Hurry!  

Dude, can he even hear us!?  

Don't worry, I'm picking up everyone's voices. Just go, Joker!  

Hm? Wait a sec!  

What the -- (Fxx) I'm getting a weird reading heading your way!  

C'mon,run !  

Tch! We got away from a bunch of those guys in back, but there're still loads more of 'em...  

Where'd they go!? Damn it!  

I can't confirm the intruder's location.

Up ahead! Stop!  

This is bad! Hide, Joker!  

You'll never get away if you just keep fighting.  

Hide in the shadows, and sneak past when you see an opening!  

Hey are you sure he came in this way?  


Understood. I will continue the search!  

Alright, now's your chance! Make a run for it!  

Ugh! How many of them are there!?  

Everything okay? The security level will rise if you take too much time.  

I know, I know! I'm looking for another route. Just hang on.  

`route: 路线，路径  `  

`hang on: 耐心等待`

```
The "hang on" in this context mean 
1. To wait patiently and not give up
2. To persevere and remain steady
3. To hold on, endure, or keep going despite obstacles  

It's an instruction asking the listener to stay calm, 
be patient, and not lose hope or quit, despite the current difficulties or delays. 
The speaker is acknowledging there is a problem or challenge, 
but is working on finding an alternative solution, 
and is asking for the listener's continued patience and perseverance during this process.

Some other examples using "hang on":

1. The rescue team told the trapped miners to hang on, help was on the way.
2. I know the project is behind schedule, but hang on, we're making progress.
3. Just hang on for one more hour, then we can take a break.
4. The CEO asked investors to hang on despite the company's short-term losses.  

So in the given context, by saying "Just hang on", 
the speaker is reassuring the listener to remain patient and keep persisting, 
as they are actively seeking another way or plan to overcome the obstacles they are facing.

```
Oh, perfect timing. Joker, Look up!  
Can you use that thing and just fly over there?  

All right, go straight from there!  

Joker---Stop!  
it's an enemy--right near you!  

Even you can't take on this many.

`take on: 应付， 应对,   confront, be willing or ready to meet an adversary or opponent.`

```
The phrase "take on" means to confront, challenge, or attempt to defeat/overcome.

Specifically, it suggests that the number of enemies nearby is too great even for 
the person being addressed (who is likely very capable) to singlehandedly engage or 
try to fight against successfully.

Some other examples using "take on" in this sense:

1. Don't take on that heavyweight boxer, he's way out of your league.
2. The small startup decided to take on the industry giants.
3. With only a few soldiers left, they couldn't take on the entire enemy battalion.
4. She's a tough negotiator, but I don't think she can take on five opponents at once.

So in the dialogue, by saying "Even you can't take on this many", it is a warning 
that the number of enemies present is too numerous and formidable for that one person 
to take them all on or try to overcome alone. 
It implies the odds are stacked too high against a single fighter.
```

Hun!?  
Joker! That weird reading from earlier's closing in on you too!

I'll end this right now

Joker, it's her, she is the weird reading I've been getting.  

My weak self relied on you so much...  
That ends today.  
Let's do this, Senpai!

The enemy readings have decreased?  
That's 

It's been a while since we last fought side-by-side.

But this time, it's my turn to come to your aid, Senpai. Now let's win this!  

I think ... that's the last of them?  

I genuinely have no clue what just happened, but I take it you're okay?  

Wait -- bad news! Enemy backup's headed your way! You need to book it, right now!

`book it: to move quickly; hurry, 快速离开`

```
In the given context, "book it" means to leave quickly or run away immediately. 
It's an informal way of saying the person needs to depart or flee from their current 
location without delay, likely because of the approaching "enemy backup" that is mentioned as a threat.

Some examples of how "book it" can be used:

1. The police arrived, so we booked it out of there fast.
2. When I heard the bear growling, I booked it back to the cabin.
3. The thugs were coming this way, so I told my friend "Let's book it!" and we ran off. 

So in the context provided, it's an urgent way of telling someone they need to get out of the 
area rapidly due to impending danger or undesirable company arriving soon.
```

Please go, I'm going to make it harder for them to track you down.  
You still have something you need to do as a phantom thief, right?  
Then I won't stop you.  
Since I'm not a member of the Phantom thieves, I'm in no position to interfere.  
However, please don't forget the promise we made, okay?  

Joker, you need to get outta there!  
Go go go!

`get outta: get out of `

All right, let's do it.  
Go up the stairs at the end of th path!  
Just a little more, so hang in there!  

He's not alone! Find them and kill them all.  
Something wrong? The exit should be up ahead.  
Through there...?  
Nnh...! That's just how it is.  
After that commotion, the bottom floor's completely closed off. Hey, can you make it!?   
Over there!  
There's nowhere to run.  
See ya.  
What a showoff.  
You are so reckless. You know that?  
Enemies here!?  
What's wrong...
These readings... It can't be!  
What happened?  
An ambush?  
Joker, can you handle this!?  
Joker! ... Oh ... No...  
Capture him...  
Suspect secured.  
Didn't expect to find some kids.  
You have your teammate to thank for this.  
You were sold out.  
Suspect confirmed. Cuff him!  






Callous Detective:  
`callous: 冷漠的,hard-hearted`  

Guess the drug was too strong...  
Wake him up.  
No dozing off.  

You still don't get it, do you?  
Give it up!  

Come on, cooperate. Or what, you want another shot?  
Huh? What about the camera?

Are you thinking it can be used as video evidence?

Of course not...  

So you are not that dumb.  
Which is good, 'cause we get to take as much time as we need!  

Obstruction of justice, blackmail, defamation, possession of weapons.  

```
defamation:  
the act of communicating false statements about a person that injure the reputation of that person  
诽谤，中伤

```
Manslaughter too, yeah? Talk about the works.

```
"talk about the works" is an idiomatic(惯用语,常用语) expression that means an extensive array or collection of things, 
often referring to criminal offenses or charges.

So when the person lists off "Obstruction of justice, blackmail, defamation, possession of weapons" and then 
says "Manslaughter too, yeah? Talk about the works," they are essentially saying that the list covers a wide 
range or full set of criminal acts or charges.

The "works" idiomatically refers to the whole shebang, the full extent or complete range of something. 
By saying "talk about the works," the person is emphasizing or drawing attention to the extensive list 
of crimes or illegal activities mentioned.

It's a colloquial way of pointing out that the list encompasses a lot --- it's not just one minor offense, 
but an array of serious criminal acts that make up the full "works" of wrongdoings or charges someone could face.
```

To think all those crimes were led by a punk like this...  
And you seemed to be enjoying every second of it... Huh?  
I was... enjoying it... ?  


Everything's hazy...  
I can't remember...  


You should know your place...

Sign here, it's a confession under your name.  


Don't expect to walk out of here in one piece.  
We're going to make you understand...  
One must take full responsibility for their actions... 


Excuse me, but his area's off-  
I'm Niijima from Public Prosecutor's office.  

The Prosecutor's office? What business do you have here?  
Just let me through; it's urgent. There's something I need to confirm with the suspect.  

Niijima-san, I believe this case is no longer in your jurisdiction.  
Besides--  
Are you Prosecutor Sae Niijima?  
I just got of phone with your director.
Hurry and get it over with. To be frank, you're being an inconvenience.
```
get over with: 
complete an unpleasant or tedious but necessary task promptly.

In this context, "get it over with" means to quickly finish or complete 
whatever task or interaction the person is referring to.

Given that the speaker addresses "Niijima-san" and claims to have spoken to her director, 
it seems they are telling the prosecutor Sae Niijima to hurry up and expedite whatever investigation, 
questioning, or legal proceeding she is currently involved in.

By saying "get it over with" in a dismissive tone, 
the speaker is implying that Niijima's work on this case is an inconvenience or annoyance to them. 
They want her to rush through it and bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible.

The phrase suggests the speaker views Niijima's activities as a tedious formality 
that just needs to be dispensed with quickly. It has an impatient, 
brusque connotation - essentially "Just get this over and done with already so we can move on."

```

I thought I ordered you to stand by.  
I'm responsible for this case, yet I'm not even being allowed an interrogation!?  
I'm calling because I knew you'd bring it up.  
I will not be convinced unless I confirm it for myself.  
This is my case.  
Good luck to you then.  
I won't be expecting much though.  

Ah, Prosecutor. I forgot to mentioned something important.  
Your time will be cut short. We can't permit you to talk with him for long.  
It's for your own sake.  
His methods are unknown. After all, we don't even know if it's safe to simply meet and speak with him.    
... I understand.  


I didn't expect it'd be you.  
You will be answering my questions this time.  
Those bastards...  
Can you hear me? It seems you've been through a lot.  
Almost anything can happen here... and I can't stop them.  
That's why I need you to answer my honestly. I don't have much time either.  
What was your objective?  
Why did you cause such major incident?  
I didn't think it was a prank from the get-go, I couldn't assemble a case for prosecution.  
It's because I couldn't figure out the methods behind it.  

`from the get-go:  from the very beginning or start.`

```
The phrase "from the get-go" is an informal idiom meaning from the outset or from the 
earliest point in time. It implies that the speaker's perspective on the situation being 
more than a prank existed from the very first moments they started looking into it.

Some other examples of how "from the get-go" can be used:

1. This project was disorganized from the get-go.
2. I knew he was trouble from the get-go.
3. They were the favorites to win from the get-go.

```

Of course you couldn't... / Why do you want to know?  
True.  
There's no way I could be convinced of such a ... world just by reading the reports.  
It seems you're coherent.  
When and where did you find that world?
How is it even possible to steal another's heart?
Now, tell me your account of everything.  
Start from the very beginning.

```
When someone is asked to give their "account of everything", 
they are being requested to provide a comprehensive, 
detailed explanation of all the relevant facts, events, actions, 
and information related to a particular situation or occurrence.

Here are a few examples using the phrase "account of everything":

1. After the robbery at the bank, the police interviewed all the witnesses 
and asked them to give their account of everything that happened, 
from the moment the robbers entered until they fled the scene.

2. The celebrity was embroiled in a scandal, and during the press conference, 
reporters demanded an account of everything, including how the events unfolded and who else was involved.

3. During the trial, the defendant was asked to take the stand and give their account of everything leading 
up to the altercation, as well as their version of what transpired.

4. The company launched an investigation into the data breach, and the IT team was instructed to provide a detailed
 account of everything, including when the breach was first detected, what systems were affected, and the steps taken 
 to contain the situation.
 
5. After the plane crash, the aviation authorities interviewed the pilots and crew members,
 requesting a full account of everything that occurred during the flight, 
 from takeoff to the moment of the accident.
 
In each of these examples, the phrase "account of everything" implies that the person being asked needs to 
provide a thorough, comprehensive recounting of all the relevant details, events, and actions related to the 
specific situation or incident in question, leaving nothing out.
```

You are held captive.  
A prisoner of fate to a future that has been sealed in advanced.  
This is truly an unjust game... Your chance of winning are almost none.  
But if my voice is reaching you, there may yet be a possibility open to you...  
I beg you. Please overcome this game... and save the world...  
The key to victory lies within the memories of your bonds -- the truth that you and your grasped.  
It all began that day... when the game was started half a year ago...  
For the sake of your world's future... as well as you own... you must remember...  


Please, help!  
Damn brat... I'll sue!   


What? Are you for real? A mental shutdown?  
It's the truth!  
Toe a person though? That's gotta be a joke.  
You really love all that occult stuff, don't you? `occult: 有魔力的，神秘的;玄妙的`  
```
Some examples that using the "You really love all that"  

1. Looking at your extensive collection of vintage comics, you really love all that pop culture memorabilia, don't you?

2. With your kitchen filled with every gadget imaginable, you really love all that fancy cooking equipment, huh?

3. Judging by the number of trophies in your den, you really love all that hunting and fishing, am I right?

4. Your basement is like a personal gym. You really love all that workout and exercise stuff, don't you?

5. I've never seen someone with so many different types of hiking gear. You really love all that outdoor adventure and 
   camping gear, it seems.
   
6. Your walls are covered in framed concert posters and vinyl records. 
   You really love all that classic rock music, I can tell.
   
7. With your shelves full of books on history and archaeology, 
   you really love all that ancient civilizations and artifact stuff, don't you?

Starting today, Sojiro Sakura will be taking care of me.  
His house should be in the backstreets of this residential area..  

The nameplate here says "Sakura." It looks like this might be Sojiro Sakura's house...  
...Even after ringing the doorbell, it doesn't look like anyone will answer the door.  
Maybe he's gone out.  

Looks like no one's home.  
Oh, yeah... Sakura-san's usually at his cafe around this time.
